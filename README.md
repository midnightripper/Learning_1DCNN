 why am i not using gradually decreasing units like simple dnn check the things to consider for the documentation.
 
 # Why
Kernel size: A kernel size of 3 is used in the Conv1D layers. This size is commonly used for 1D convolutional operations and can effectively capture local patterns and dependencies within the sequence. Smaller kernel sizes allow the model to capture fine-grained details, while larger kernel sizes can capture broader patterns. You can experiment with different kernel sizes to find the optimal choice for your specific task.

Units: In the suggested model, 64 units are used in the first Conv1D layer, and 128 units are used in the second Conv1D layer. The number of units determines the capacity and complexity of the layer. Increasing the number of units allows the model to learn more complex patterns and capture more high-level features. However, it's important to strike a balance to avoid overfitting, especially with limited data. You can adjust the number of units based on the complexity of your task and available computational resources.

## 1DCNN Model for Pattern Recognition

This repository contains an implementation of a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) for pattern recognition. The model is designed to learn complex patterns and features from 1D input data.

### Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of the following layers:

1. Conv1D layers: These layers learn local patterns and relationships within the input data. The number of filters and kernel size can be adjusted to capture specific features.

2. MaxPooling1D layers: These layers downsample the output, reducing spatial dimensions and extracting the most important features.

3. Flatten layer: This layer converts the output from the Conv1D layers into a 1D vector.

4. Dense layers: These layers learn higher-level representations and make predictions based on the extracted features. Dropout regularization is applied to prevent overfitting.

### Parameter Selection

The parameters for the 1DCNN model were chosen based on the following considerations:

- Filters: The number of filters was selected to allow the model to capture a wide range of patterns in the input data.

- Kernel Size: A kernel size of 3 was chosen to capture local patterns and relationships within a small window of neighboring data points.

- Activation Function: ReLU activation function was used to introduce non-linearity and enable the model to learn complex patterns.

- Pooling: MaxPooling1D layers were added to downsample the output and extract important features.

- Dropout: Dropout regularization was applied to reduce overfitting by randomly disabling units during training.

The model was compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. The accuracy metric was used for evaluation.

### Improving Accuracy

To further increase accuracy, you can consider the following steps:

- Increase the complexity of the model by adding more Conv1D layers or increasing the number of filters.

- Adjust the kernel size to match the scale of patterns expected in the data.

- Experiment with different network architectures, such as adding recurrent layers for capturing temporal dependencies.

- Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset.

- Fine-tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, or dropout rate, through systematic experimentation and validation.
